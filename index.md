### Visualization
As scientists and statisticians,we must inform our community


We must find a way to appeal to the masses

In this study, I will use data from married couples in the United States, to go into detail on the strengths and weaknesses of different visuals.

### Same-sex and Different-sex Marriage
If we want to understand marriage's nuances, it is essential to investigate all forms of unions present in the United States. Marriage has long been defined in a rigid binary between men and women. Although, the reality has been that many same-sex couples have shared lives. Past studies of romantic relationships have neglected to include same-sex couples in their analysis

This study aims to visualize and quantify differences between gay, lesbian, and straight relationships. This comparison will be approached by analyzing multiple variables such as: 

```
Coping with stress
Taking care of their sick partner
Positive communication between partners
Sharing of power in a relationship
            &
Happiness with the relationship
```

### Hypothesis
```
H1: Depending on the relationship type (gay, lesbian, and straight) there will be a significant difference between how participants indicate that their partner helps them with stress

H2: Depending on the relationship type there will be a significant difference between the level of care presented to sick spouses 

H3: Depending on the relationship type there will be a significant difference between participants indication that both partners have the same power in the relationship

H4: Gay, lesbian, and straight couples will not show a significant difference in how they score their happiness with the relationship

H5: There will not be a significant difference between the communication of gay, lesbian and straight couples

```
## Results
### Demographics

This study analyzed responses from 838 participants. 
The sample had an age range from 35 to 65, with a median age of 48.60 (SD =8.380246). The sample was divided into three relationship types that participants could fall under: Gay (Men with Men) (29.6%), Lesbian (Women with Women) (40.8%), and Straight (Men with Women) (29.6%). Most of the sample identified as White (90.1%), followed by Black (3.9%), and Asian / Pacific Islander (3.2%).  Additionally, a small number also reported being Hispanic/Latino (4.3%).

### Power Difference
Participants were asked to indicate if they agreed to the statement:

“My spouse and I have equal power in our relationship”

Participants had the option to select that they: Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither agree nor disagree, Agree, or Strongly agree. A two-sample test of proportions was conducted between Lesbians’ (49.7%) and Gays’ (44.8%) indication that they strongly agreed, (1, N= 342,248) =1.2204, p=0.2693. Additionally, the same test of proportions was conducted between Lesbians’ (49.7%) and Straights’ (37.1%), indication that they strongly agreed to the statement, (1, N= 342,248) =8.7569, p=0.003.
